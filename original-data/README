This package contains the data of the AnEM (Anatomical Entity Mention)
corpus, version 1.0.3.

This README provides a brief overview of the package contents. See the
LICENSE file included in the package for the data license, the
manuscript referenced at the bottom of this file for an introduction
of the corpus, and the project homepage

    http://www.nactem.ac.uk/anatomy/ 

for data visualizations, supplementary data and more information.


CONTENTS

This package contains the following:

* README:       this file
* LICENSE:      licenses of the texts and annotations
* REFERENCES:   references to articles from which extracts are used
* development:  development split of entity annotations in BIO format
* test:         test split of entity annotations in BIO format
* standoff:     all annotations in standoff format
* scripts: 	scripts for working with the corpus data


FORMAT

The corpus data is provided in two formats: a BIO format and a
standoff format.

BIO format

The data in the development/ and test/ directories are provided in the
column-formatted BIO representation used in many reference resources
for mention detection such as that of the CoNLL shared tasks (see
e.g. http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2002/ner/). Each line contains four
TAB-separated columns: token text, start offset, end offset, and tag.
An example:

white   579     584     B-Multi-tissue_structure
matter  585     591     I-Multi-tissue_structure
of      592     594     O
rat     595     598     O
spinal  599     605     B-Organ
cord    606     610     I-Organ

Each tag consist of one of the letters B, I or O (for "begin", "in",
and "out"), and the type of the entity for the B and I tags. (The
offsets into the source text are provided for reference and can be
ignored for most applications.)

The entity mention detection task is to learn to predict the tags
(last column) given the token texts (first column).

Standoff format

The data in the standoff/ directory are provided in the standoff
format used by the brat annotation tool (http://brat.nlplab.org/). For
details of the format, see the documentation page
http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html


EVALUATION

The corpus is intended to serve as an evaluation standard for
anatomical entity mention detection. For this purpose, the
development/ and test/ directories contain the following files:

* AnEM.train
* AnEM.test

The .train files contain data to be used for training during method
development and final evaluation, and the corresponding .test files
contain the data to be used for testing.

The proposed approach to method development and evaluation is to use
the test/ data only for final evaluation after completing method
development. In particular, it is not an acceptable to use the
test/AnEM.test file contents to tune method parameters (or, of course,
to train methods).

The development/ and test/ directories additionally contain the files
train-files.list and test-files.list, which list the names of the
source files that have been combined to create the corresponding
training and test data files.

PLEASE NOTE: the data in the development/ and test/ directories are
not separate: the development/ data is a split of the data in the
test/AnEM.train file.

The evaluation script evalbio.pl in scripts/ can be used to evaluate
predictions against the gold test data as follows:

    evalbio.pl PREDICTIONS GOLD

for example

    evalbio.pl AnEM.predictions development/AnEM.test

The predictions should have the same BIO format as the provided data.
